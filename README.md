# PseudoProof

Using ML models and generative AI to identify fabricated datasets in academic papers  

## Project done @ Le Wagon Bootcamp by:  
Ana√Øs Pepey, Mariano Rubio and Despoina Kotsopoulou  

Inspired from previous research by Michael S. Bradshaw and Samuel H. Payne

## Basics  
- Upload a csv dataset you have suspicions about onto the website
- Let the random forest model do the work...
- Download the results: the original dataset completed with our prediction per row
  - 1: this row has likely been fabricated by a machine
  - 0: this row is likely authentic
