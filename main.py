## what the interface should provide:

# 1st step:

# preprocess data (csv file to pandas df) as 2 modalities
# 1 df with raw data
# 1 df with digits occurence

# initialize (if relevant), fit, train... on these 2 dfs
# 5 ML models
# 1 RNN

# display prediction and accuracy measures of each model (2 modalities and 1 model/ page)


# 2nd step:

# import a true dataset (csv file)

# produce a fake dataset from the imported dataset

# train model to produce/ detect fake datasets
